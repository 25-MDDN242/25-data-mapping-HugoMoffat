## Creative Coding + AI II: Custom Pixel

## Blurry Fish in Acid Dimension by Hugo Moffat

## Design Process

    - Commented any code out that didn't draw over mask to keep the grayscale background as I felt it made what ever I drew uing the mask pop.

    - In an attempt to use tris instead of ellipses, I accidentaly set all of the tri's third points to the same coordinates. This caused the image to become very stretched as though it as going very fast or it were near a blackhole or something similar.

    - While toying with the colourmode in the first curLayer I changed it from RGB to HSB, this caused the image to be very vibrant. Despite being the complete opposite to what I had previously, still made the fish stand out from the background.

    - The hyperbolic time dialated fish were unfortunately difficult to comprehend as fish. Paring down to quads, their sharp edges still provided a dynamic feel to the fish

    - To make the background MORE interesting, I added an amount if randomness to the height and width of the ellipses being drawn. I was dissatisfied with the wobbly gaps between each ellipse, so I changed them to rects. The rects create a boxy, greebled effect that I prefer to the ellipses'.

    - Pulling from prior experiments, I drew both ellipses and quads over the fishes to flesh them out a little more. This combination caused the fish to look fuzzy, almost like they were made out of fabric.
